# AI_String_Builder
A string building program that demonstrates the use of a genetic algorithm

How to Use

In “Target String” field, type in a String of any length. Note that longer Strings will take longer to process.

In “Population” field, type in an Integer from 200 – n.

In “Mutation” field, type in an Integer from 1 – 5. This is a percentage of 100.

Note: of course, you can have anywhere up to 100% mutation but this will cause the genetic algorithm to not preform as intended. If mutation rate is at 100% this means that after every Crossover all the characters in a string will be ‘mutated’ which means every character will be randomized to a new character. You can see that this will make the algorithm almost never get to the target string. On the flip side if mutation rate is 0% you can come into a situation where the population is all the same string which leads to Crossover doing nothing.
